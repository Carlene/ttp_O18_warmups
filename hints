-- HINTS:
-- start by getting all PG-13 films

-- find the cheapest rental bracket, the cheapest rental_rate

-- find the NEXT HIGHER rental_rate above $1

-- Go back and make a new column "new_rate", with a CASE WHEN statement to return the 
-- new price for all PG-13 films.
-- HINT: try hardcoding first
-- HINT: Get your code to run with one of the changes to make sure you can get the 
-- CASE WHEN statement to work, then add the other change.

-- Do the previous query with softcoding (opposite of hardcoding, ie using a subquery/etc
-- to find the right rental brackets.)
